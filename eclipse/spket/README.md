Spket JS formatter rules
=====================================

This folder contains the JS formatter config file for Eclipse's Spket plugin. You'll need to install the plugin first, and restart Eclipse.

Then, you can import the config file like indicated in the screenshot below (click `Import...`).

You may want to set the Spket as default JS editor too:

Once the formatter is installed, you can use `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`F` keyboard shortcut to format your JS file using AT team rules.
